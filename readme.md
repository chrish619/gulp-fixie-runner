# gulp-fixie-runner
[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin to wrap the Fixie Console runner within your gulpfile.js. 

## Why?
I wanted to load the Fixie tests within a gulp task, using the pipe / glob syntax that gulp already provides.
And there was no other (current) implementation

## TODO
* Yeah, I have to right some test stuff

## Disclaimer
Some code borrowed from [gulp-nunit-runner](https://github.com/keithmorris/gulp-nunit-runner), mainly for debugging purposes
